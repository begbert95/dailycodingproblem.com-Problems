Daily Coding Problem: Problem #14 [Medium]

Problem:

The area of a circle is defined as πr^2. Estimate π to 3 decimal places using a Monte Carlo method.

Hint: The basic equation of a circle is x2 + y2 = r2

Thoughts:

I'm not familiar with the Monte Carlo method, so I'll have to look it up. After doing so, I would need to spend more time learning and understanding the method in order to code it. I don't think it's a good use of my time at the moment, so I found the solution here: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/estimating-value-pi-using-monte-carlo/
