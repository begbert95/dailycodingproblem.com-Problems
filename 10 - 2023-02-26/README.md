Daily Coding Problem: Problem #10 [Medium] 

Problem:

Implement a job scheduler which takes in a function f and an integer n, and calls f after n milliseconds

Thoughts:

The only difficult part is taking in a function. I don't know if there's a way to do it besides converting a string of the function name and converting it. Gonna need to look it up.

Looks like it's literally a regular parameter. It took a bit to figure out how to get it to *function* properly
